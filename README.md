## A useful movable ur_grasp_driver

The workspace is a nearly complete robot arm control sysytem based on vision. It containes packages not only like Moveit, RDE, but also containes some self-built frame work to better handle ros2. 

It is built under Ros2 humble.

Hopfully it can help to build a workspace faster, rather than build from the beginning everytime. 

```sh
cd yc_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```
